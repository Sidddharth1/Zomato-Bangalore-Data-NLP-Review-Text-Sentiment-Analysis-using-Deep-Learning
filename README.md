# Zomato-Bangalore-Data-NLP-Review-Text-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning


Zomato Restuarant Dataset:

This dataset contains reviews (text), ratings, cuisines etc features. We will perform an EDA on the dataset and then build a prediction model, using NLP and Deep Learning to predict if the review sentiment is positive or negative (sentiment analysis).

This is an intermediate model and by no means a complete model, we can go through another phase of hyperparameter tuning to tweak our the performance of our model further.
